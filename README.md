# Vruum

### About
Vruum is a personal project, about a fictional driving school.

### Technologies / Softwares
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015+)
- Adobe Photoshop (22.0)
- Adobe Illustrator (25.2)

### Architecture / Conventions
- **SMACSS**: is more style guide than rigid framework. There is no library within here for you to download or install. There is no git repository for you to clone. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS. And really, who isn’t building a site with CSS these days?! (http://smacss.com/)
